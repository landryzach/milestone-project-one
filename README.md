# milestone-project-one
I chose blackjack, becuase it seems like a simple game to build. This is my first solo project from scratch and we have a short period of time to create the project, so a simple game seemed logical. Also, blackjack is the only casino game I've actually played and gambled on, so there is the smallest bit of person history there as well.
