I chose blackjack, becuase it seems like a simple game to build. This is my first solo project from scratch, and we have a short period of time to create the project, so a simple game seemed logical. Also, blackjack is the only casino game I've actually played and gambled on, so there is the smallest bit of person history there as well.

Game details:
Goal of the game is to get 21, or to get closer to 21 than the other user.
Ace = 1
Jack, Queen, King = 10
Game starts on window load.
The deck is randomized, and to cards are given to each player.
Either player can "Hit Me" as many times as they want until their score is greater than 21. 
If a user goes over 21, a message appears stating the other user has won the game. 
After the "Ok" button is pressed, another message will appear towards the bottom of the page stating the game will restart in 5 seconds.
Once the user hits the "Stay" button, the "Hit Me" button is disabled until the next game.
Right now, the end game function is tied to User2's stay button. I will continue to work so I can find a solution where the end function is invoked after both "Stay" buttons are pressed, regardless of order.
I am currently working to add card images to each user.
I'll add a home screen, which I originally had, and have the game start on a button.
I'll also continue to work on the CSS, so the game looks better.
If you guys have any suggestions for improvement, please let me know so I can continue to grow my knowledge!
